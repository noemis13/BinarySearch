1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1.

2. Compute guess as the average of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer).

3. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return guess.

4. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then set min = guess + 1.

5. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = guess - 1.

6. Go back to step 2.
